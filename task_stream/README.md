This task emphasizes the use of Java Streams for data processing and analysis, requiring students to apply complex stream operations, lambda expressions, and method references to manipulate data and generate insights. These tasks not only test the students' understanding of Java Streams and functional programming concepts but also challenge them to solve real-world problems efficiently using these tools. The ability to craft and understand complex stream pipelines is crucial for data manipulation tasks in Java, showcasing an advanced level of Java programming skills.

#### 4.1 Java Streams I: Event Planning (6 Points)

**Objective**: Develop a prototype for event management at TU Berlin following a cyberattack. This prototype aims to provide insights into upcoming events using Java Streams to process event data.

**Key Java Skills**:
- Utilization of Java Streams for data processing.
- Application of lambda expressions and method references to complete stream pipelines.
- Data manipulation and analysis to generate insights from a given dataset.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- Complete the implementation of three static methods in the `UniversityEvents` class within the `events` package. These methods involve stream pipelines that lack the actual logic in lambda expressions.
- Ensure that modifications are made only where necessary, without altering the predefined steps of the pipelines.
- Test the solution with the `TestUniversityEvents` class.

#### 4.2 Java Streams II: University Statistics (14 Points)

**Objective**: Assist in creating graduation statistics for Berlin universities using Java Streams, based on lists of courses offered by universities and students who have completed them.

**Key Java Skills**:
- Advanced usage of Java Streams to generate statistics from lists.
- Crafting complex stream pipelines to solve statistical problems.
- Understanding and implementation of nested streams where necessary.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- Implement six static methods in the `UniversityEvents` class within the `stats` package to produce the expected output as specified in each method's description.
- Focus on modifying only the return statement of each method to fit the entire solution into a single stream pipeline.
- Adhere to the restrictions of using only Java Streams within the return statement and avoiding the use of external methods or classes developed by the user.
- Validate the implementation with the `TestUniversityStats` class.
