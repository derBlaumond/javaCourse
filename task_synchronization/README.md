#### 2.1 Athletes and Their Dumbbells (20 Points)

**Objective**: Manage a scenario where double the expected number of athletes are present in a gym class due to an administrative oversight, leading to a shortage of dumbbells. Each athlete needs two dumbbells to perform their exercises, but there are only as many dumbbells as there are athletes. The task involves coordinating threads (representing athletes) to ensure each athlete can successfully train with two dumbbells without causing deadlocks, where athletes are unable to proceed because they all hold one or no dumbbell.

**Key Java Skills**:
- Thread management and synchronization to prevent race conditions and deadlocks.
- Design and implementation of a system where shared resources (dumbbells) are accessed concurrently.
- Ensuring thread safety and atomic access to shared objects.

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Gym.java**: 
    - Implement the `setup()` method to initialize the gym with all athletes (`Athlete`) and dumbbells (`Weight`). 
    - Ensure each `Athlete` object is initialized with two `Weight` objects, one representing the left dumbbell and the other the right. 
    - Assignments of dumbbells to athletes must be circular, meaning the right dumbbell of the last athlete is also the left dumbbell of the first athlete.
    - The method should handle edge cases such as negative numbers of athletes or cycles.

2. **Weight.java**:
    - Implement the `isAvailable()`, `pickUpImpl()`, and `putDownImpl()` methods inherited from the `AbstractWeight` class.
    - Ensure that a dumbbell can only be held by one athlete at a time and manage the logic for an athlete to pick up and put down a dumbbell, considering thread safety for the `isAvailable()` method.

3. **Athlete.java**:
    - Represent athletes as threads by extending the `AbstractAthlete` class which itself inherits from `Thread`.
    - Implement the `run()` method to define the sequence of actions an athlete performs: stretching, picking up both dumbbells, training (exercising), and putting down both dumbbells.
    - Ensure the sequence adheres to the requirement that an athlete must hold both dumbbells to train, and manage access to dumbbells to prevent deadlocks and ensure fairness.

**Testing**:
- Validate your solution with the provided test classes `TestGymSetup`, `TestWeightAccess`, and `TestTrainingSequence` to check the setup logic, access control to the dumbbells, and the training sequence respectively.

This homework focuses on advanced concurrency and synchronization topics in Java, requiring skills in thread management, synchronization primitives or techniques (like monitors or semaphores, though not explicitly mentioned, these concepts underlie the problem's solution), and the practical application of these concepts to solve a complex problem involving shared resources and potential deadlocks.
